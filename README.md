# Open Source Smart Watch (OSSW) Arduino

https://hackaday.io/project/196896-hackable-smart-watch-with-app

## Description

This is the Arduino code running an SSD1327 display and a nrf52840 Feather

## Objective

The ultimate objective is to have this code running a smart device and another repository with code to make a phone app that pairs with it.

The first objective is basic connetivity and functionality that someone can copy and use as desired.

I decided to start this project since I wanted such a pair of items and couldn't find any without a ton of extra code that I didn't need.
